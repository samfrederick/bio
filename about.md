I work as a post-baccalaureate contractor with ORAU for U.S EPA's Office of Research and Development where I evaluate the performance of air quality sensors against federal reference methods for monitoring criteria pollutants. I also work with EPA colleagues to establish and implement performance targets, metrics, and protocols for the evaluation of air sensors used in fixed-site, ambient outdoor settings.

As an undergraduate, I completed a thesis using computational magnetohydrodynamic simulations to model the structural deformations of highly magnetic pulsars.
