I work as a post-baccalaureate contractor with [ORAU](https://www.orau.org/index.html) for [U.S EPA's Office of Research and Development](https://www.epa.gov/aboutepa/about-office-research-and-development-ord) where I evaluate the performance of air quality sensors against federal reference methods for monitoring criteria pollutants. I also work with EPA colleagues to establish and implement performance targets, metrics, and protocols for the evaluation of air sensors used in fixed-site, ambient outdoor settings.

As an undergraduate, I completed a [thesis](https://samfrederick.github.io/bio/media/docs/frederick-thesis.pdf) using computational magnetohydrodynamic simulations to model the structural deformations of highly magnetic pulsars.
