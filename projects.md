[_Modeling Magnetohydrodynamic Equilibrium in Magnetars with Applications to Continuous Gravitational Wave Detection_](https://samfrederick.github.io/bio/media/docs/frederick-thesis.pdf)
- Constructed a C-based computational model for magnetar stellar structure with strong magnetic fields by implementing magnetohydrodynamic simulation via the PLUTO code for astrophysical gas dynamics.
- Quantified structural deformation due to magnetic field strength via measurement of stellar ellipticity by evaluating changes to the principal moments of inertia of the star.
- Determined estimates for continuous gravitational wave strain resulting from stellar deformation assuming axisymmetric deformations orthogonal to the rotational axis.
- Found simulation results to be within reasonable prediction of published wave strain estimates for highly-magnetic pulsar sources.
